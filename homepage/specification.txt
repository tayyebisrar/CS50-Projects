In my homepage, I have used:
1. <script>
2. <nav>
3. <button>
4. <ul>
5. <li>
6. <a>
7. <section>
8. <h1>
9. <span>
10. <strong>
and more.

For CSS, 5 examples of things I've used are:
1. display
2. flex-direction
3. justify-content
4. align-items
5. width

I used JavaScript to implement a function that opens a pdf file in another tab when a button is clicked.
I used BootStrap to create a navbar with their classes, as well as the <code> tag for styling purposes.
