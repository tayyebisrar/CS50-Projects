# CS50-Projects
This is a repository full of the projects I have completed as part of the CS50 problem sets.

These files are all solutions to the 9 'Problem Sets' given as part of the Harvard University course, 'CS50: Introduction to Computer Science'.

This course runs from July to December, and consists of weekly lecture from Professor David J Malan of Harvard University. 

A few of the later problem sets, i.e. Weeks 4-6, may provide the student with some boilerplate code, particularly for problems which include content or syntax not covered in the lecture.

The wide range of topics covered are available at this link: https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science
