# CS50-Projects
This is a repository full of the projects I have completed as part of the CS50 problem sets.

These files are all solutions to the 9 'Problem Sets' given as part of the Harvard University course, 'CS50: Introduction to Computer Science'.

This course runs from July to December, and consists of weekly lecture from Professor David J Malan of Harvard University. 

A few of the later problem sets, i.e. Weeks 4-6, sometimes provide the student with some boilerplate code, particularly for problem sets which include content not covered in lecture.

The wide range of topics covered are available at this link: https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science
