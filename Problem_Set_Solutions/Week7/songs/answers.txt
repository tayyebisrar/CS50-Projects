To calculate a user's Audio Aura from their top 100 songs, you would first find the averages of their energy, valence and danceability.
e.g.
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

You can judge these values to decide what the user's aura would be. For example a high energy would have an energetic Audio Aura.
This still might not be representative of the listener's aura, as their top 100 songs might not exactly reflect their overall personality.
Also, only including 3 aspects of songs won't properly represent the songs. You could include tempo, loudness, and speechiness for example.
